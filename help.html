        <h1>How can you help?</h1>
        <p>
        Interested in starting a similar project in your local community? Here is an outline to help you out!
        <ul>1. Plan</ul>
        Planning is essential to this process. This step first includes brainstorming different ideas. Maybe you want to start an art program like I did, or maybe you want to teach karate classes. Whatever it may be, you have to write a general outline of what you want to accomplish. This way, both you and the organization you may be partnering with will have a good idea about the program. It shouldn't take too long, since you may already have a general idea of what you want to do; all you have to do here is write them down.
        <ul>2. Contact</ul>
        The hardest part of any project is <b>initiative</b>. Anyone can have an idea, but it's getting started that sets you apart from the others. The first part of taking initiative is always contact. Whether that means emailing different organizations or calling phone numbers of local autism schools, it is important to take this step in contacting various places. For me, I did a simple Google search of local autism schools. I then visited their website to find their contact information. You can send them your outline that you finished in Step 1 and perhaps add additional information that pertains to the organization.
        <ul>3. Start</ul>
        After getting approved, you can start the program! It may be intimidating at first, since you may not have any experience with projects similar to the one you are starting. However, you are finally able to see all the hard work you have put into Steps 1 and 2 finally oaying off. In my opinion, this is the most rewarding step of the process.
        <ul>4. Spread awareness</ul>
        You can actually complete this step without completing the preceding ones simply by sharing this website on Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit. By spreading awareness of how to start projects similar to this one, you can benefit communities worldwide. The impact of the project will thus be global, rather than local. 
        This was a brief outline of all the steps, but make sure to contact me if you have any further questions!
